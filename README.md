# Introduction 


Respresso is a centralized resource manager for shared [Android](https://github.com/pontehu/respresso-client-android), [iOS](https://github.com/pontehu/respresso-client-ios) and [web](https://github.com/pontehu/respresso-sync-for-clients#web) projects.
It allows you to simply import the latest assets into your workspace.
You may store several versions of the same resource in the cloud and pick the ones you need to import.
Respresso currently supports five types of resources:
* Images
* App icons
* Localization
* Fonts
* Colors
* Raw


# Usage

Using Respresso should be intuitive to anyone who has used npm before.
Configurations are stored in the *respresso.json*, while your current assets’ metadata are stored in *respresso.lock*.

⚠️ You'll need java installed on your machine.

## Configuration

In *respresso.json* you can customize:
- projectToken: received during initialization of your project in the Respresso web interface
- targetDirectory: it should be under src as CRA does not import from elsewhere
- resources: only import what you need and you can change the version number, too

The currently accepted resource names are:
* image
* appIcon
* color
* localization
* font
* raw
        
Accepted version formats are:
* [major].[minor].[patch]         eg. 1.2.0
* [major].[minor].[patch]+         eg. 1.2.0+ (not available in strict mode)
* [major].[minor]+                eg. 1.2+ (not available in strict mode)

## Include resources into your web application

To start using Respresso in your app takes almost zero time and effort. 

1. Add to your dev devendencies:   
```
npm install respresso --dev
```
2. Add a sync script into your *package.json*:
```
"scripts": {
	"sync": "respresso sync",
        ...
        }
```
3. After configuring your Respresso project, just issue ```npm run sync``` and you can start using the resources.


# Respresso Angular demo.

### Localization

This demo uses [@ngx-translate](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core), so you can find all relevant info there. Respresso files are imported in *src/app/app.module.ts*.

### SASS

You need to import the color definitions in every scss files :( You can find a sample in *src/app/app.component.scss*.

### Images

Find a sample use of svg in *src/app/app.component.ts*.
